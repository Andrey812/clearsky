Clear Sky

The game written using node-webkit.
There is map splitted to the several fields like a grid.
Every field consists some random generated text.

There are player's base in the bottom of the map and enemies
which moves around of the map and launches missiles to the base.

The main idea of the game is destroying enemies by typing
text displayed in the each map's field.

If player will type all letters of the fields's text,
the strike will be made to this field and the strike
will damage or destroy all enemies which are moving
in the border of the field.

The graphics of the game was made like a radar's screen.
All enemies are aircrafts - planes, helicopters, missiles etc.

The base in the bottom of the map is the player's land, which
attaked by enemy aircrafts.

Player must destroy all enemies before they will launch count of missiles
for destroying of the player's base.

How to execute:
- Open index.html in the browser with WebKit (or its fork - Blink) engine (Ex: Chromium browser)
OR
- Install node-webkit (https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) and run "./nw 'path to clearsky directory'"
